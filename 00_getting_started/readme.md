     ```sh
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

   - For **Debian-based** distributions (e.g., Ubuntu), run:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install git
     ```
   - For **RPM-based** distributions (e.g., Fedora), run:
     ```sh
     sudo dnf install git
     ```

## ⚙️ Step 2 Configuring Git

After installing Git, you need to configure it with your personal information. This information will be used for your commits. 📝

### 👤 Set Your Username

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

*Replace `"Your Name"` with your actual name.*

### 📧 Set Your Email Address

```sh
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

*Replace `"your.email@example.com"` with your actual email address.*

### ✔️ Verify Your Configuration

To verify your configuration, use the following command:

```sh
git config --list
```

This command will display the current configuration, including your username and email. 📋


## 📚 Step 3: Getting Help

Git provides a built-in help system to assist you with commands and their usage. Let's explore how to access and utilize these resources. 🆘

### 🆘 Basic Help Command

To get help about any Git command, use:

```sh
git help <command>
```

*For example, to get help with the `commit` command:*

```sh
git help commit
```

### 🔄 Alternative Help Commands

You can also use the following commands to access help:

```sh
git <command> --help
```

or

```sh
git <command> -h
```

*These alternatives provide the same assistance as the basic help command.*
