## 🔍 Introduction

Git provides the `git blame` command to **track the origin** of each line in a file, revealing the **commit** and **author** responsible for the changes. 🖥️ By using `git blame`, you can **identify who made specific modifications**, understand **when changes were introduced**, and **trace the evolution** of a file over time. This is invaluable for **code reviews**, **debugging**, and **collaborative development**. 📈 This guide demonstrates how to use `git blame` effectively to uncover the authorship of individual lines in your files. Let’s explore how! 🕵️‍♂️🔧

## 🛠️ Blaming the File

The `git blame` command annotates each line in a file with information about the last commit that modified that line. This section covers the most commonly used `git blame` commands, along with **detailed explanations**, **example commands**, and **example outputs** to help you utilize them effectively.

### 1. `git blame <file-name>` 📄

**Description:**  
Displays a **detailed annotation** for each line in the specified file, showing the **commit hash**, **author**, **timestamp**, and **content** of the last change to each line.

**Features:**
- **🔍 Line-by-Line Annotation:** Provides granular details for each line.
- **🔑 Commit Hash (`<commit-hash>`):** Identifies the specific commit responsible for the change.
- **👤 Author Information (`<author>`):** Shows who made the change.
- **🗓️ Timestamp (`<date>`):** Indicates when the change was made.
- **✍️ Line Content:** Displays the actual content of the line.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Running `git blame <file-name>` annotates each line of the specified file with information about the **last commit** that modified it. This allows you to **trace back** changes to their origins, helping you understand the **context** and **reasoning** behind each modification.

**Example Command:**
```bash
git blame audience.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```
a1b2c3d4 (Jane Doe 2024-04-30 12:47:34 +0500 1) Introduction to the audience section.
e4f5g6h7 (John Smith 2024-04-29 09:15:30 +0500 2) This line explains the target demographics.
z9y8x7w6 (Jane Doe 2024-04-28 14:23:45 +0500 3) Additional details about audience engagement.
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Code Reviews:** Identify who wrote or modified specific lines for targeted feedback.
- **Debugging:** Trace the origin of problematic code to understand its history.
- **Documentation:** Document the evolution of a file by understanding who contributed what.
- **Accountability:** Ensure that changes are properly attributed to their authors.

### 2. `git blame -e -L <start>,<end> <file-name>` 📜

**Description:**  
Blames only the specified **range of lines** (e.g., lines 1 to 2) in the file, including the **email addresses** of authors in the output.

**Features:**
- **📏 Line Range (`-L <start>,<end>`):** Focuses on a specific subset of lines.
- **📧 Email Addresses (`-e`):** Includes the authors' email addresses for more precise identification.
- **🔍 Focused Annotation:** Provides detailed information for a targeted section of the file.
- **🗂️ Efficient Scanning:** Quickly assess specific parts of large files without overwhelming output.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The `-L <start>,<end>` option allows you to **limit the blame output** to a specific range of lines within the file. Combined with the `-e` option, which includes the authors' email addresses, this command provides a **detailed and focused** view of who modified specific lines and when.

**Example Command:**
```bash
git blame -e -L 1,2 audience.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```
a1b2c3d4 (Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com> 2024-04-30 12:47:34 +0500 1) Introduction to the audience section.
e4f5g6h7 (John Smith <john.smith@example.com> 2024-04-29 09:15:30 +0500 2) This line explains the target demographics.
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Targeted Analysis:** Examine specific sections of a file to understand changes in detail.
- **Security Audits:** Review critical lines for security-related modifications.
- **Feature Tracking:** Track changes in a particular feature or module within a file.
- **Collaborative Projects:** Coordinate with specific team members based on their contributions to certain lines.
