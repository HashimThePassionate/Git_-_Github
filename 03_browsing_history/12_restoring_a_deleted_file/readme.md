## 🛠️ Deleting a File

Before restoring a deleted file, it's essential to understand how to **delete files properly** in Git. This ensures that the deletion is tracked and can be reverted if necessary.

### 1. `git rm <file-name>` 🗑️

**Description:**  
Deletes the specified **file** from the **working directory** and **stages** the deletion for the next commit.

**Features:**
- **🗑️ File Removal:** Permanently removes the file from your project.
- **📦 Staging Deletion:** Prepares the deletion to be recorded in the repository's history.
- **🔄 Consistent State:** Ensures the working directory reflects the removal.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The `git rm` command is used to **remove files** from both the **working directory** and the **staging area**. This ensures that the file is deleted from your project and that Git is aware of the deletion, preparing it to be recorded in the next commit.

**Example Command:**
```bash
git rm toc.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```
rm 'toc.txt'
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Cleanup:** Remove unnecessary or obsolete files from the project.
- **Refactoring:** Delete files as part of restructuring the codebase.
- **Error Correction:** Remove files that were accidentally added to the repository.

### 2. `git commit -m "Remove toc file"` ✍️

**Description:**  
Commits the **deletion** of the file with an appropriate **commit message**.

**Features:**
- **✍️ Commit Message:** Documents the reason for the file removal.
- **📦 Record Keeping:** Adds the deletion to the repository's history.
- **🔄 Version Control:** Ensures the change is tracked and can be reverted if needed.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
After staging the file deletion with `git rm`, the `git commit` command is used to **record** this change in the repository's history. The commit message should be **descriptive** to provide context about why the file was removed.

**Example Command:**
```bash
git commit -m "Remove toc file"
```

**Example Output:**
```
[main a1b2c3d] Remove toc file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 toc.txt
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Documentation:** Clearly document the removal of files for future reference.
- **Collaboration:** Inform team members about changes in the project structure.
- **History Tracking:** Maintain a clear history of all changes made to the repository.

## 🔄 Restoring the Deleted File

If a file has been deleted, Git allows you to **restore** it by retrieving it from a previous commit. Follow these steps to effectively restore a deleted file.

### 3. `git log --oneline` 📄

**Description:**  
Displays the **commit history** to identify the previous state of the file.

**Features:**
- **📄 Concise History:** Shows commits in a simplified, one-line format.
- **🔍 Easy Navigation:** Quickly browse through commit messages and SHAs.
- **🕰️ Historical Insight:** Provides context on when changes were made.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Before restoring a deleted file, it's crucial to **identify the commit** where the file last existed. The `git log --oneline` command provides a **brief overview** of the commit history, making it easier to locate the specific commit you need.

**Example Command:**
```bash
git log --oneline
```

**Example Output:**
```
a642e12 Restore toc file
b20af3f Remove toc file
c1d2e3f Add toc file
d4e5f6g Update documentation
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Identify Commit:** Find the exact commit where the file was last present.
- **Historical Reference:** Understand the sequence of changes leading to the deletion.
- **Preparation:** Gather necessary information before performing the restore.

**Features:**
- **🔑 Targeted Restore:** Retrieves the file from a specific commit.
- **📂 File Restoration:** Brings back the deleted file to the working directory.
- **📦 Staging Restoration:** Stages the restored file for the next commit.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Once you've identified the commit where the file last existed, use the `git checkout` command to **restore** it. This command retrieves the file from the specified commit and places it back into your working directory, allowing you to **recover** the deleted file.

**Example Command:**
```bash
git checkout a642e12 toc.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```
M       toc.txt
```

**Use Cases:**
