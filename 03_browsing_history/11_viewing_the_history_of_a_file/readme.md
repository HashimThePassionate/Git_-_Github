## 🛠️ Viewing Commit History

The `git log` command is a powerful tool for **inspecting the history** of your repository. When combined with specific options and file paths, it allows you to **focus** on the changes made to individual files. 📜 Below are the most commonly used `git log` commands for viewing the history of a file, along with **detailed explanations**, **example commands**, and **example outputs** to help you utilize them effectively.

### 1. `git log <file-name>` 📄

**Description:**  
Displays the **commit history** of the specified **file**. This includes information about each commit that **modified the file**, such as the **commit message**, **author**, **date**, and **commit hash**.

**Features:**
- **🔍 Detailed Commit Information:** Provides comprehensive details for each commit affecting the file.
- **📜 Full Commit Messages:** Shows the complete commit messages for better context.
- **👤 Author Attribution:** Identifies who made each change.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Running `git log <file-name>` allows you to **inspect the history** of a particular file within your repository. This command filters the commit history to include only those commits that have **altered the specified file**, making it easier to **trace the evolution** of that file over time.

**Example Command:**
```bash
git log src/App.js
```

**Example Output:**
```

### 2. `git log --oneline <file-name>` 🔍

**Description:**  
Shows a **condensed version** of the commit history for the specified **file**, displaying only the **abbreviated commit hash** and **commit message** in a **single line** for each commit. This is useful for **quickly scanning** through the commit history of a file.

**Features:**
- **🔑 Abbreviated SHA:** Provides a shortened version of the commit hash for readability.
- **📝 One-Line Commit Messages:** Displays the first line of each commit message.
- **📄 Concise Output:** Offers a streamlined view of the file's history without extensive details.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The `--oneline` option simplifies the output of `git log` by **condensing each commit** into a single line. When used with a file path, it focuses solely on the commits that have **affected that file**, allowing for a **quick overview** of its history.

**Example Command:**
```bash
git log --oneline src/App.js
```

**Example Output:**
```
a1b2c3d Refactored App component for better performance
e4f5g6h Fixed routing bug in App.js
z9y8x7w Added new feature to App.js
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Quick Overview:** Get a rapid summary of changes made to a file.
- **Efficient Navigation:** Easily navigate through recent commits without the verbosity of full commit details.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare the frequency and nature of commits to a file over different periods.
