## ✏️ 1. Make Changes to Files

First, make the necessary changes to the files in your working directory. For example, let's append the word "python" to `file1.txt`. 🖊️

```bash
echo python >> file1.txt
```

*Example:*

```bash
echo python >> file1.txt
```

*What This Does:*
- **`echo python >> file1.txt`**: Appends the word "python" to the end of `file1.txt`. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created with the content "python".


## 💾 2. Commit Changes Directly

To skip the staging area and commit all modified files directly, you can use the `-a` flag with `git commit`. This will automatically stage any tracked files that have been modified and commit them with the provided message. 📦✍️

### 📌 Syntax

```bash
git commit -am "Your commit message here"
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git commit -am "Add python to file1.txt"
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`git commit`**: Records the changes in the repository.
- **`-a`**: Automatically stages files that have been modified and deleted. New files (untracked) are **not** staged.
- **`-m "Add python to file1.txt"`**: Adds a commit message inline describing the changes.

*Best Practice:* Use this method for quick commits when you're certain about the changes you're committing. It streamlines the process but bypasses the opportunity to review changes before committing.


## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Use with Caution**: Only use this approach when you're certain that you don't need to review the changes before committing. It's convenient for quickly committing changes, but it bypasses the opportunity to review individual changes. 🛑

- **For Tracked Files Only**: This command will **only** commit changes to tracked files. **Untracked files** will **not** be committed. To include new files, you need to stage them first using `git add`. 📂➡️📦


## 📝 Summary

- **Make Changes to Files**: Modify your files as needed in the working directory.
- **Commit Changes Directly**: Use `git commit -am "message"` to skip the staging area and commit all modified **tracked** files directly.
- **Use with Caution**: Ensure you're comfortable with the changes being committed without prior review.
- **Understand Limitations**: Only tracked files are affected; untracked files require explicit staging.


🎉 **Great Job!** 🎉 You've successfully learned how to skip the staging area and commit changes directly in your Git repository. This method is a powerful way to streamline your workflow when managing tracked files. 🚀
