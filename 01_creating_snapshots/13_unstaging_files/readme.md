## ✏️📄 1. Make Changes to a File

Start by making changes to a file in your working directory. This could involve modifying existing content or adding new content. 🖋️✨

### 📌 Command

```bash
echo fishes >> moon/main.js
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
echo fishes >> moon/main.js
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`echo fishes >> moon/main.js`**: Appends the word "fishes" to the end of the `main.js` file located in the `moon` directory. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created with the content "fishes".
  
*💡 Tip:* Regularly saving changes helps in tracking progress and maintaining an accurate history of modifications.

---

## ➕📂 2. Add Changes to Staging Area

After modifying the file, add the changes to the staging area. This prepares the changes to be included in the next commit. 📥✅

### 📌 Command

```bash
git add moon/main.js
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git add moon/main.js
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`git add moon/main.js`**: Stages the changes made to `main.js`, indicating to Git that these changes should be included in the next commit.

*💡 Tip:* Use `git add .` to stage all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories.

---

## 🔄❌ 3. Undo Staging Changes

If you decide that you do not want to include the staged changes in your next commit, you can **undo staging** and move the changes back to the unstaged state. This allows you to modify or discard changes before committing. 🔄🛑

### 📌 Command

```bash
git restore --staged moon/main.js
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git restore --staged moon/main.js
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`git restore --staged moon/main.js`**: Removes `main.js` from the staging area, moving the changes back to the unstaged state. The file remains modified in your working directory.

*⚠️ Note:* This command does not discard your changes; it simply unstages them. Your modifications remain intact and can be re-staged or discarded as needed.

*💡 Tip:* To discard the unstaged changes and revert the file to its last committed state, use:
  
```bash
git restore moon/main.js
```
