## 📝🔍 1. View Staged Changes

To see the differences between the last commit and the files currently staged for the next commit, use the `git diff --staged` command. This provides a clear view of what will be included when you make your next commit. 📂✅

### 📌 Command

```bash
git diff --staged
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git diff --staged
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`git diff --staged`**: Compares the staged changes with the last commit, showing what is ready to be committed.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for reviewing changes before finalizing a commit to ensure accuracy and completeness.

### 📋 Example Output

```diff
diff --git a/moon/main.js b/moon/main.js
index e69de29..d95f3ad 100644
--- a/moon/main.js
+++ b/moon/main.js
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+console.log("Hello, Git!");
```

- **`+`**: Lines added to the file.
- **`-`**: Lines removed from the file.

## 🔄📊 2. Compare Staging Copy with Last Commit

The `git diff --staged` command allows you to compare the version of the file in the staging area with the version in the last commit. This helps in understanding the exact changes that are staged for the next commit. 📈🔍

### 📌 Command

```bash
git diff --staged
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git diff --staged
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **Purpose**: To verify that the staged changes align with your intended modifications.
- **Benefit**: Helps in catching any unintended changes before committing, ensuring a clean and accurate project history.

### 📋 Example Output

```diff
diff --git a/moon/main.js b/moon/main.js
index e69de29..d95f3ad 100644
--- a/moon/main.js
+++ b/moon/main.js
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+console.log("Hello, Git!");
```

- **Interpretation**: The output shows that a new line has been added to `main.js`, which will be included in the next commit.

## 📝✏️ 3. View Unstaged Changes

To view the differences between your working directory and the staging area, use the `git diff` command. This shows modifications that have not yet been staged for commit. 📂🔄

### 📌 Command

```bash
git diff
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git diff
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`git diff`**: Displays changes that have been made to tracked files but are not yet staged.
- **Use Case**: Useful for reviewing changes before deciding to stage them for commit.

### 📋 Example Output

```diff
diff --git a/moon/main.js b/moon/main.js
index d95f3ad..f3d2e1b 100644
--- a/moon/main.js
+++ b/moon/main.js
@@ -1 +1 @@
-console.log("Hello, Git!");

```

- **`+` and `-`**: Indicates lines added and removed, respectively.
- **Interpretation**: Shows that the log message has been changed from "Hello, Git!" to "Hello, Python!".

## 🔍📂 4. Compare Untracked or Unstaged Changes

Running `git diff` without any additional arguments compares the untracked or unstaged changes in the working directory with the version in the staging area. This helps in identifying what has been modified or added without being staged. 🆕

### 📌 Command

```bash
git diff
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git diff
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **Purpose**: To identify changes that have not been staged, including both modifications to tracked files and the addition of new untracked files.
- **Benefit**: Enables you to decide which changes to stage and commit, maintaining control over your project's history.

### 📋 Example Output

```diff
diff --git a/moon/main.js b/moon/main.js
index d95f3ad..f3d2e1b 100644
--- a/moon/main.js
+++ b/moon/main.js
@@ -1 +1 @@
-console.log("Hello, Git!");
+console.log("Hello, Python!");
```

- **Untracked Files**: New files that have been created but not yet added to the staging area will appear under "Untracked files" when you run `git status`, but they won't appear in the `git diff` output unless you explicitly add them.
