## 📝🔍 1. Check Short Status

Begin by checking the short status of your repository. The short status provides a concise overview of the changes in the working directory. 📋✨

### 📌 Command

```bash
git status -s
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git status -s
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`git status -s`**: Displays the status in a short format, making it easier to quickly assess changes.

*Example Output:*

```
?? file1.txt
?? file2.txt
```

- **`??`**: Indicates untracked files that are not yet being tracked by Git.

---

## ✏️📄 2. Append Content to a File

Make changes to your files by appending content. For instance, append the word "sky" to `moon/main.js`. 🖊️🌌

### 📌 Command

```bash
echo sky >> moon/main.js
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
echo sky >> moon/main.js
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`echo sky >> moon/main.js`**: Appends the word "sky" to the end of `main.js` inside the `moon` directory. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created with the content "sky".

---

## 🆕📂 3. Create a New File

Create a new file within a directory. For example, create `file2.js` inside the `moon` directory with the content "mountains". 🆕🖥️

### 📌 Command

```bash
echo mountains > moon/file2.js
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
echo mountains > moon/file2.js
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`echo mountains > moon/file2.js`**: Creates a new file named `file2.js` in the `moon` directory with the content "mountains".

## 📋🔎 4. Check Detailed Status

Check the detailed status of your repository to view modified and untracked files. This provides a comprehensive view of all changes. 📊🔍

### 📌 Command

```bash
git status
```

### 🛠️ Example

```bash
git status
```

### 📝 Explanation

- **`git status`**: Displays the detailed status of the repository, showing staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

*Example Output:*

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   moon/main.js

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        moon/file2.js
```

- **`modified:`**: Indicates files that have been modified but not yet staged.
- **`Untracked files:`**: Lists files that are not being tracked by Git.
