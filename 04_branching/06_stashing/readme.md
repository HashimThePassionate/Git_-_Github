## 🔍 Introduction

In the fast-paced world of software development, you often find yourself needing to **temporarily set aside changes** without committing them. Git's **stashing** feature allows you to **save your uncommitted changes** and **reapply them later**, enabling a smoother and more flexible workflow. 📂 Whether you're switching contexts, working on multiple features simultaneously, or needing to quickly address a critical bug, stashing provides a safe way to manage your work-in-progress. 🛠️ This guide outlines the steps to **stash changes**, **manage stashes**, and **reapply them** effectively. Let’s explore how! 🕵️‍♂️🔧


## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide to Stashing

Follow these steps to effectively use Git's stashing feature to manage your uncommitted changes:

### 1. Switch to the Bugfix Branch 🔄

**Description:**  
Switches the current working branch to the `bugfix` branch to work on fixing a bug.

**Command:**
```bash
git switch bugfix
```

**Example Output:**
```
Switched to branch 'bugfix'
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Task Isolation:** Work on bug fixes without affecting the main branch.
- **Parallel Development:** Manage multiple development tasks simultaneously by switching between branches.


### 2. Make Changes ✏️

**Description:**  
Make necessary changes to files in the branch. For example, append "Hello" to the `audience.txt` file.

**Command:**
```bash
echo Hello >> audience.txt
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Feature Development:** Implement new features or enhancements.
- **Bug Fixing:** Modify code to address identified issues.


### 3. Attempt to Switch Branches Without Committing Changes ❌

**Description:**  
Attempt to switch back to the `master` branch without committing the changes made in the `bugfix` branch. Git will prevent this to avoid overwriting uncommitted changes.

**Command:**
```bash
git switch master
```

**Example Output:**
```
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
     audience.txt
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Prevent Data Loss:** Git safeguards your uncommitted changes by preventing accidental overwrites.
- **Workflow Control:** Encourages proper management of changes before switching contexts.


### 4. Stash Changes 📦

**Description:**  
Stashes the current working directory and index state, saving your uncommitted changes with a descriptive message.

**Command:**
```bash
git stash push -m "New line Hello added in stash area"
```

**Example Output:**
```
Saved working directory and index state On bugfix: New line Hello added in stash area
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Context Switching:** Temporarily set aside changes to work on something else.
- **Work-In-Progress Management:** Save unfinished work without committing it.


### 5. Create a New File 🆕

**Description:**  
Create a new file named `file.txt` and check the repository status to see untracked files.

**Commands:**
```bash
echo Hi > file.txt
git status -s
```

**Example Output:**
```
?? file.txt
```

**Use Cases:**
- **File Creation:** Add new files that are yet to be tracked by Git.
- **Project Expansion:** Start working on new components or resources.


### 6. Stash the New Changes 📦

**Description:**  
Stashes the new untracked file along with other changes, saving them with a descriptive message.

**Command:**
```bash
git stash -am "My new stash"
```

**Example Output:**
```
Saved working directory and index state On bugfix: My new stash
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Comprehensive Stashing:** Save both tracked and untracked changes.
- **Temporary Storage:** Keep your workspace clean while addressing urgent tasks.


### 7. View the Stash List 👀

**Description:**  
Lists all the stashes, showing their reference names and associated messages.

**Command:**
```bash
git stash list
```

**Example Output:**
```
stash@{0}: On bugfix: My new stash
stash@{1}: On bugfix: New line Hello added in stash area
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Stash Management:** Keep track of multiple stashes.
- **Selective Application:** Identify which stash to apply based on the messages.


### 8. Switch Back to the Master Branch 🔙

**Description:**  
Switches the current working branch back to the `master` branch after stashing changes.

**Command:**
```bash
git switch master
```

**Example Output:**
```
Switched to branch 'master'
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Resume Main Development:** Continue working on the main codebase.
- **Integrate Changes:** Prepare to merge stashed changes into the main branch.


### 9. Apply a Specific Stash 🔧

**Description:**  
Shows the changes in the specified stash number and applies the stash to the working directory.

**Commands:**
```bash
git stash show 1
git stash apply 1
```

**Example Output for `git stash show 1`:**
```
audience.txt | 2 +-
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

**Example Output for `git stash apply 1`:**
```
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   audience.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Selective Restoration:** Apply only specific stashed changes as needed.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Reapply stashed changes to a different branch while managing conflicts.


### 10. Drop a Specific Stash ❌

**Description:**  
Removes the specified stash from the stash list to clean up unnecessary stashes.

**Command:**
```bash
git stash drop 1
```

**Example Output:**
```
Dropped refs/stash@{1} (a28d97d5c3c0a857f32b0e312cbf0213a236e19e)
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Cleanup:** Remove stashes that are no longer needed to keep the stash list manageable.
- **Resource Management:** Free up resources by deleting unused stashes.


### 11. Clear All Stashes 🗑️

**Description:**  
Removes all stashes from the stash list, effectively clearing the stash area.

**Command:**
```bash
git stash clear
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Complete Cleanup:** Remove all stashed changes when they are no longer needed.
- **Reset State:** Ensure a clean slate by deleting all temporary stashed changes.


## 🔄 Additional Tips

Enhance your Git stashing workflow with these additional tips:

- **List Stashes with More Details:**
  ```bash
  git stash list --stat
  ```
  **Use Case:** Get a summary of what each stash contains in terms of file changes.

- **Apply and Drop a Stash in One Command:**
  ```bash
  git stash pop
  ```
  **Use Case:** Apply the latest stash and remove it from the stash list simultaneously.

- **Create a Branch from a Stash:**
  ```bash
  git stash branch new-feature-stash
  ```
  **Use Case:** Create a new branch from a specific stash, allowing you to work on the stashed changes in isolation.

- **View Stash Contents Without Applying:**
  ```bash
  git stash show -p stash@{0}
  ```
  **Use Case:** Inspect the detailed changes in a stash before deciding to apply or drop it.

- **Include Untracked Files in Stash:**
  ```bash
  git stash push -u -m "Stash with untracked files"
  ```
  **Use Case:** Stash both tracked and untracked files to ensure all changes are saved.

- **Apply a Stash to a Different Branch:**
  ```bash
  git switch target-branch
  git stash apply stash@{0}
  ```
  **Use Case:** Reuse stashed changes in a different context or branch.

- **Use Git Extensions:** Tools like **GitLens** for VS Code provide enhanced visualization and management of stashes.
  
  **Use Case:** Gain deeper insights and more intuitive management of stashes directly within your code editor.
